        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>
            Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was founded by four of the most brilliant witches 
            and wizards of their time. It was founded in the 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, 
            Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin. Each of them created a house in their names and thus established 
            one of the best schools in the wizarding world. Many of the individuals in each house have similar traits 
            or qualities as the original founders. Young witches and wizards receive their letters to Hogwarts at the 
            mere age of 11 years old. Before beginning their schooling , each student must first be sorted into their 
            correct houses by the magical Sorting Hat.

            <p>Godric Amaryllis Gryffindor was a British pure-blood wizard and one of the four founders of Hogwarts 
                School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was the husband of Salazar Slytherin, father of Laoise Slytherin 
                and Julian Gryffindor, and one of the ancestors of Tom, Kamaria, Andros, Aquarius, and Katara Prince-Slytherin, 
                and ancestor-in-law to Severus and Ginevra Prince-Slytherin.

            <p>Rowena Ravenclaw (fl. c. 993) was a Scottish witch and one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 
                and Wizardry. She was noted for her intelligence and creativity. Ravenclaw died sometime in the eleventh century, 
                after she fell fatally ill. Legend had it that a broken heart was the cause â€” because her daughter Helena ran away 
                with her diadem. Rowena's portrait remained at Hogwarts.

                and Wizardry. While the other founders chose to have special students, she accepted them all without preference, 
                although she did want them to be loyal and hard-working. Helga's portrait remained at Hogwarts by at least the 1980s.
